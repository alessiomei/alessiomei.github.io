Astrophysics fundamentally is a funny story that I love to tell to others (people who shared a beer with me know it too well). I had a great time doing outreach activities of any kind, here's a list of them.

IDeAS (Incontri di Divulgazione e Astrofisica in Sardegna)
------

In 2022, I joined [IDeAS](https://linktr.ee/ideas_1794), a non-profit outreach association born with the goal of sharing science in Sardinia and everywhere it usually does not arrive. With them, I:
* Participated to **_Scientzia in Bidda_**, an event of seminars, workshops and public debates made across Sardinia. In 2023, for the first event, I advertised it on the local radio [Radiolina](https://radiolina.it/) :) 
* Participated to **_Cuatru Cuartus de Scièntzia_**, multilingual outreach events
supported by INFN, INAF, GSSI and Physics Department of University of
Cagliari.

* Participation to **_Fotosintesi - Arte sostenibile_**, artists residency in Sant’Antioco (Sardinia), carrying out the outreach event _Tutte le direzioni della luce_, where we discussed about the Sun and Moon with astronomical observations. This event was organized by [Ottovolante Sulcis](https://ottovolantesulcis.it/) in collaboration with [IDeAS](https://linktr.ee/ideas_1794).

* Organized **_On the Edge of the Eyelid_**, artistis residency between L'Aquila and Museo Nivola of Nuoro (Sardinia), carrying out outreach events between art and science.
