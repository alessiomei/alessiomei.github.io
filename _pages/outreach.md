Astrophysics, fundamentally, is a funny story that I love to tell others (people who've shared a beer with me know it all too well). I've had a great time doing outreach activities of any kind, here's a list of them.

IDeAS (Incontri di Divulgazione e Astrofisica in Sardegna)
------

In 2023, I joined [IDeAS](https://linktr.ee/ideas_1794), a non-profit outreach association born with the goal of sharing science in Sardinia and everywhere it does not usually arrive. With them, I:
* Participated in **_Scientzia in Bidda_**, an event of seminars, workshops and public debates made across Sardinia. In 2023, for the first event, I promoted the event on the local radio [Radiolina](https://radiolina.it/) :) 
* Participated in **_Cuatru Cuartus de Scièntzia_**, multilingual outreach events
supported by INFN, INAF, GSSI and Physics Department of University of
Cagliari.

* Participated to **_Fotosintesi - Arte sostenibile_**, artist residency in Sant’Antioco (Sardinia), hosting the outreach event <q>_Tutte le direzioni della luce_</q>, where we discussed about the Sun and Moon with astronomical observations. This event was organized by [Ottovolante Sulcis](https://ottovolantesulcis.it/) in collaboration with [IDeAS](https://linktr.ee/ideas_1794).

* Organized **_On the Edge of the Eyelid_**, artist residency between L'Aquila and Museo Nivola of Nuoro (Sardinia), carrying out outreach events and discussions between art and science. 

SHARPER
------

I participated to [SHARPER](https://www.sharper-night.it/), an event during the European Researchers' Night consisting of a series of outreach shows in the streets of L'Aquila. In the editions of 2021, 2022 and 2023 I actively participated making experiments and outreach talks to a lay audience regarding experiments in the [Gran Sasso National Laboratories](https://www.lngs.infn.it/it) and Astrophysics.

Space Explorers
------

I participated to outreach events organized at GSSI for young school groups. We prepared lectures and games about physics and space!



PhTea Talks
------

In 2022, I co-founded and co-organized the PhTea Talks, a series of seminars made by GSSI students to lay audience. The topics covered by these seminars are chosen by the speakers, and they can include whatever the speaker finds interesting for people to hear about. They are a good practice for students to make a public speech, and for the audience to listen to something interesting and funny :) I started this series of seminars with a talk named <q>_The hitchhiker’s ruler for the Galaxy- How to measure distances in astrophysics_</q>. [Here](https://www.instagram.com/alumni.gssi/) we show the fliers of the most recent events. 


Astronomy On Tap
------

During my visit to Copenhagen, I participated to [Astronomy On Tap](https://astronomyontap.org/) hosted in the wonderful venue of [HUSET](https://huset.kk.dk/en), giving an outreach seminar on gamma-ray bursts. In return, I got free beer.

The Science Breaker
------

Following [my publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05404-7) in _Nature_, I was asked to write an [outreach article](https://www.thesciencebreaker.org/breaks/earth-space/long-or-short-doesnt-matter-the-tale-of-an-unusual-gamma-ray-burst) explaining the impact of that discovery to lay audience. It is published in [The Science Breaker](https://www.thesciencebreaker.org/), a website collecting outreach articles with the goal of disseminate researches published in scientific articles.


Media
======

The publication of [my work](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05404-7) in _Nature_ was covered by the media. 

* Here you can find my interviews for the [GSSI](https://www.gssi.it/communication/news-events/item/20826-sorprendenti-lampi-gamma-ad-alta-energia-dalla-fusione-di-due-stelle-di-neutroni), [INAF (Italian Astrophysics National Institute)](https://www.media.inaf.it/2022/12/07/gssi-inaf-grb-211211a/) and [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/universe/nasa-missions-probe-game-changing-cosmic-explosion/) press releases. 
* This discovery was also featured in the Italian daily newspaper [_La Repubblica_](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2022/12/07/news/spazio_scoperti_lampi_gamma_ad_alta_energia_dalla_fusione_di_due_stelle_di_neutroni-377897469/?__vfz=medium%3Dsharebar&fbclid=PAQ0xDSwKEFwNleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABp-BRqZ6tQGD9jmu068Jd75mcQINhOnahRW4GVlcd_TFWwtIIxvunqFJygEgh_aem_i7-CvmYSI4zezffQnsMrIQ). 
* My PhD advisors, Biswajit and Marica, and I appeared in a YouTube video for <q>Meet the Researchers</q>, a short series of videos made by GSSI to spread researches carried out in the institute (in italian).
