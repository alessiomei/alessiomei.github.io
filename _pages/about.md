Hi! I'm an astrophysicist studying gamma-rays from the most powerful explosions in the Universe. 
Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the [Gran Sasso Science Institute](https://www.gssi.it/) in L'Aquila, Italy.

My academic experience in short
------

I started my PhD position in Astroparticle Physics at GSSI in 2020, where I joined the [Gravitational-wave group](https://wikiet.gssi.it/index.php/Main_Page) lead by Prof. Marica Branchesi and Prof. Jan Harms. In particular, I joined the division studying gamma-ray bursts, and I was supervised during my research by Dr. Gor Oganesyan, Prof. Marica Branchesi and Dr. Biswajit Banerjee. 

Previously, I got both my BSc and MSc degrees in Physics at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, and my diploma at Liceo Scientifico "E. Amaldi" in Rome.
