Hi! I'm an astrophysicist studying gamma-rays from the most powerful explosions in the Universe.

My academic experience in short
------
I am currently a fixed-term researcher at [INAF - Observatory of Brera](https://brera.inaf.it/) in Merate (Italy) as part of the [Niel Gehrels Swift Observatory](https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/) collaboration.

I got my PhD in Astroparticle Physics at [Gran Sasso Science Institute](https://www.gssi.it/) in L'Aquila (Italy), after I joined the [Gravitational wave group](https://wikiet.gssi.it/index.php/Main_Page) lead by Prof. Marica Branchesi and Prof. Jan Harms. In particular, I worked in the division studying gamma-ray bursts. During my research, I was supervised by Dr. Gor Oganesyan, Prof. Marica Branchesi and Dr. Biswajit Banerjee. I defended my thesis titled "_On the common properties across the gamma-ray burst population: discovering a standard behavior and unique events_" in June 2025.

Previously, I got both my BSc and MSc degrees in Physics at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, and my diploma at Liceo Scientifico "E. Amaldi" in Rome.
